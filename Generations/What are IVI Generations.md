**What are IVI Generations?**

The IVI Generation item specifies a set of minimum IVI specification
versions with which a specific driver must comply in order to claim
compliance with a specific IVI Generation. The IVI Foundation web site
contains a list of the IVI Generations and the minimum specification
versions required to claim compliance with each.

The IVI Generation is designated in the form of “IVI-\<year\>”, where
\<year\> is the year following the year in which the specification
changes that constitute the new generation were approved. The following
are examples of existing IVI Generations: IVI-2003, IVI-2014. This item
is not present for IVI custom specific drivers or IVI class drivers, and
it is not required for IVI-2003 drivers.

Since the IVI generation are cited based on a year, the Technical
Committee identifies the generation year based on the year following the
most recent specification change in a particular generation. Drivers
initially released on or after January 1, following the generation year,
shall comply with the IVI generation of the previous year.

For instance, if the latest specification revision in the generation is
February, 2134, the IVI generation would be IVI-2135. IVI compliant
drivers initially released on or after January 1, 2136 would be required
to comply with the IVI-2135 generation.
